If you would like to suggest a term to be added to the glossary, please make an issue in the GitHub repository.\n\nMetadata\nInformation that describes the data\nThis is the information someone else needs to understand and reuse your data. It might describe a sensor deployment, a tag deployment, definitions of column names, units in which variables were measured, or project information.\n\n\nFAIR principles\nFindable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable\nThese principles were first published in Scientific Data in 2016, and have been widely adopted by many organizations and people who work with data. How the principles are put into action and measured are topics of active research and development.\n\n\nLicensing\nDefines what a user is allowed to do with a dataset\nLicensing makes the terms of reuse explicit to the user. Check with your organization or institution and any other data owners to assist in choosing a license. Choose the least restrictive license to ensure the widest possible reuse of the data.\n\n\nPID\nPersistent identifier, e.g. ORCiD, DOI, ROR\nThese identifiers help disambiguate people, research products, and organizations. They support getting credit for your work or funding, and finding digital objects.",
