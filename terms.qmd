*A more expansive list of terms can be found in our [glossary](glossary.qmd).*
*If you would like to suggest a term to be added to the glossary, please make*
*an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intertidalagency/ia-data-stewardship/issues).*

  

### Metadata

*Information that describes the data*  

This is the information someone else needs to understand and reuse your data.  It
might describe a sensor deployment, a tag deployment, definitions of column names, 
units in which variables were measured, or project information.  

### FAIR principles

*Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable*  

These principles were first published in [Scientific Data in 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18), and have been widely adopted by many organizations and people who work with data.  How the principles are put into action
and measured are topics of active research and development.  

### Licensing

*Defines what a user is allowed to do with a dataset*  

Licensing makes the terms of reuse explicit to the user.  Check with your organization
or institution and any other data owners to assist in choosing a license.  Choose 
the least restrictive license to ensure the widest possible reuse of the data.  

### PID

*Persistent identifier, e.g. ORCiD, DOI, ROR*  

These identifiers help disambiguate people, research products, and organizations.
They support getting credit for your work or funding, and finding digital objects.
